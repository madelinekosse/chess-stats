# Chess stats

A library for parsing PGN chess games into a format containing the game state after each move.

Forked from [Magnus](https://github.com/Anders-E/Magnus) and reliant upon [clj-pgn](https://github.com/mdallastella/clj-pgn). All the code in `game_state` is copied directly from Magnus, and clj-pgn is used to parse PGN files.
